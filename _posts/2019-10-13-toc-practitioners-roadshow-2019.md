I've visited [ToC practitioners roadshow 2019](http://toc.org.pl/roadshow-praktykow-toc-2019/){:target="_blank"} organized by [ToC+ Institute](http://toc.org.pl){:target="_blank"} earlier this month in 5 cities in Poland. I wanted to share my experience after touring Kraków and Warsaw editions. Those who ware absent can start regretting decision not to go. 

## TL;DR

Key takeaways:

- It's real, Goldratt was right: applying Theory of constraints puts your business on a new level of performance.
- People are resistant to change, be ready for hard work.

## "It's only in the books" argument killed

This is the biggest value of this event. Usually when you discuss ToC with somebody the first argument and resistance to change is an excuse similar to the following:

> Awesome book! However it's only a theory - an ideal world presented in the book. Reality is different.
 
This argument gets killed after visiting the roadshow. You can listen to all presentations, you can ask questions, probe the speakers both publicly or in person. 

It's real. First-hand accounts. The world presented in Goldratt's books gets incarnated in all case studies presented. The patterns and mechanics of Theory of constraints are very visible and clear. I mean here e.g. "subordinate everything to the constraint" rule - see list of cases below to see what it does mean in practice.

## Broad range of real-world examples

It was extremely helpful to see very broad scope of ToC applications. I've listened to 6 case studies and all presented by top managers or business owners. Most of the stories come from recent months including cases where year ago an implementator new literally nothing about ToC.

**In each case speakers was forced to actually work in the very workcenter being a constraint in his organization. Imagine a thin company director working full shift on an exhausting machine in a big factory :)** Perfect example of the "subordinate everything" step of ToC.

#### Insights and stories

Speakers ware asked interesting questions, revealing many, sometimes shocking, insights about the process of applying Theory of constraints:

- **salesman -> blue collar** - company owner convincing top salesman to become a manual worker and to work in the constraint - awesome case!
- **vandalism and threats** - colleagues destroyed one employee's locker as a threat and "advice" not to cooperate with company management.
- **engineer as taxi driver** - temporarily moving an educated engineer, employed as factory technologist, to become a taxi driver for a salesmen on hundreds-kilometers-long distances
- **heroics** - brave act of doing best to protect sales and throughput, learning to do complex welding overnight by a company owner or to go to a repairing service at 4 a.m. in the morning.
- **state-owned hospital** - public hospitals don't have good reputation in Poland. An extraordinary case where employees worked miracles by behaving as genuine businessmen, drastically eliminated waste and queues - typical problem in Poland's health care system
- **conquering sales** - making the company to be actual owner of the sales process - instead of salesman who can exit a company together with "his" clients. Building highly effective sales system using ToC techniques
- **mafia offer** - introducing operational advantage that enabled creating an offer that customer simply cannot refuse
- **do I look like a salesman?** - building sales process on top of unqualified people among whom there is no typical salesman

To name a few!

## Trainings

I also had a unique chance to participate in a "Change and leadership" workshop run by [Joanna Drucka - Podbereska](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joanna-katarzyna-drucka-podbereska-586543150/) from [ToC+ Institute](http://toc.org.pl){:target="_blank"}.
 
It was decent portion of new knowledge, very interesting discussions with the trainer and participants followed by lot of inspirations and self-reflection. It opened my eyes on a few topics related to driving change.  
 
## Networking

Event was a very rare experience to get networked with new people interested in the topic. It gathered lot of people being familiar with ToC. Almost all I spoke with read [The Goal](https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271951){:target="_blank"} book already.

Networking was very well supported by:

- city-center location of the venue, both Kraków and Warsaw
- good infrastructure of networking space, lunch downstairs, free coffee, tea, snacks etc.

Industries the people I spoke with came from:
injection moulding, 
plastics manufacturing, 
publishing, 
logistics, 
consulting, 
poligraphy, 
banking, housing development and software development.

What was the only problem for me is that event was in polish only. This was problematic as, working in an international company, it limits number of colleagues I could engage to go to the event. On the other hand I do understand this, as it's difficult to find speakers and preparing a speech is very time consuming - especially in foreign language.

Despite the issue above, The Roadshow was unquestionably very beneficial networking event.

## Fun

There ware lot of funny situations during the event. Both in the networking area and on the stage. My favourite was a business card draw. One of the awards was real bare metal indoor bin! It is special as it was produced in the factory managed by Wojciech Maziarz who successfully applied ToC in sales. 

In Kraków edition the man collecting gifts confused gadgets and took a normal bin from the corridor - together with garbage inside! It has happened as all the bins in the hotel was from the very same factory! It was discovered quite late - when the gift was being handed to the winner :)

Probability works so next day in Warsaw the bin award was given...

...to me! Brand new in this case. Proud of myself! Not a small one, and I had to take it back to Kraków by train.
